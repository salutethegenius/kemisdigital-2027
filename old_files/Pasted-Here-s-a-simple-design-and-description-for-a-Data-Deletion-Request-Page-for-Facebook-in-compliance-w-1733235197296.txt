Here’s a simple design and description for a Data Deletion Request Page for Facebook in compliance with their platform policies:

Data Deletion Request Page

Purpose: This page allows users who interact with KemisDigital via Facebook to request the deletion of their personal data collected by the app, as per Facebook’s Data Deletion Instructions.

Page Content

Header:

If you encounter any issues with the form or have further questions, contact us at [Insert Contact Email].

Implementation Notes:

	•	Form Submission: Ensure the form submits securely via HTTPS to your backend.
	•	Backend Handling: Create an endpoint to handle requests, validate the user’s identity, and trigger the deletion process.
	•	Confirmation: Send a confirmation email to the user once the deletion is complete.
	•	Compliance: Follow Facebook’s Data Deletion Callback URL process, if applicable, for immediate deletion requests.
